# These tests exercise a representative part of the public API of the scope
# class in order to make sure that the scope object is constructed correctly
# and the API works as expected. They are not meant to exhaustively test the
# implementation of the underlying classes providing the API.
#
# These tests are supposed to not change much when the implementation of the
# scopes is changed, so they can serve as documentation of the API and basic
# expectations towards the API.
#
# Testing on this concrete level makes it easier to see that the scopes work
# in general. Only testing this on the more abstract level of the classes used
# to implement the scopes bears the risk of missing cases or only exposing them
# implicitly in other tests where they are harder to diagnose. This helps
# especially when refactoring the implementation of the scopes.
